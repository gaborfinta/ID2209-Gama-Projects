# Course project for Distributed AI and Intelligent Agents course in KTH University

Exercises for the course are focused around the festival topic. Agents in this scenario communicate with each other and try to act in a way to fulfill their goals. The assignments were built on top of each other. More details about the tasks can be found in the corresponding folders.

The tasks were solved with GAMA which is a simulation platform focused on agent simulations in 3D space. More info: https://gama-platform.github.io/
